I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and work on interesting projects. If you have a project that you think I'd be a good fit for, or if you're interested in working with me, please feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:jbrodovsky@temple.edu?subject=Collaboration%20Opportunity). I'm always open to new opportunities and I'm happy to discuss how we can work together.

## Research Interests

I'm currently working on a number of projects related to autonomous navigation systems, particularly in the context of marine or aerospace grade navigation and in GPS-/GNSS-denied scenarios. If you have a background or interest in such systems and would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and work on interesting projects.

My particular research thrust at the moment is investigating the use of particle filters and geophysical signals (primarily bathymetry/radar altimetry, gravity anomaly, and magnetic anomaly) to improve the accuracy and robustness of autonomous inertial navigation systems. I'm also interested in the use of machine learning and computer vision techniques to improve the robustness of these systems in challenging environments.

## Consulting

I'm also available for consulting work in the areas of robotics, autonomous systems, and software development as well as previous experience as a startup founder. I'm available for short-term or long-term consulting engagements and I'm happy to discuss how I can help you with your project or work with your due diligence team to evaluate a potential investment.
