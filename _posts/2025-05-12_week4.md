Option A: “What I Thought This Was vs. What It’s Becoming”
A reflection on how your idea is evolving

What problems you’ve ruled out

Which ideas got stickier after real conversations

You’re not building a product yet — you’re reshaping a hypothesis into a vision.

🔁 Option B: “What Industry Still Doesn’t Understand About GNSS-Denied Navigation”
You’ve talked to people now. What do they get wrong?

Where is the disconnect between research and real-world practice?

How could this space benefit from new thinking, new tools, new formats?

Great for showing thought leadership + domain clarity

🔁 Option C: “The Technology Stack I Wish Existed”
Map your ideal dev stack, hardware/software environment, or SDK

Include where Rust, Python, geophysics, and navigation meet

It’s aspirational — but grounded

This is like a product vision without calling it a product
